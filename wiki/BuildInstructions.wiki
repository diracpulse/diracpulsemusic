#summary Instructions for Building The Code

_It is assumed you have already checked out the source code_

== Step 1: Compiling the C Code ==

See DFTFolder for more information

Open your Unix Command Line Tool (ex. MSYS) _if needed_<br>
Navigate to the DFT folder in the source code<br>
run: gcc - O3 main.c filter.c<br>
(This was tested under Windows Vista using MinGW and MSYS)<br>
It is important to optimize for speed, since the algorithms are computationally intensive.<br>
Output: a.exe<br>
Place a.exe into the DFTEditor folder (same directory as DFTEditor.jar)<br>

== Step 2: Building the Java Code ==

See DFTEditorFolder for more information

If you are using an operating system other than Windows, see OSSpecificCode, and make any necessary changes before building !DFTEditor.jar

It is assumed you have references to ANT and Java in your PATH variable in Windows (or the equivalent in your OS of choice)

Double click on c.bat in the !DFTEditor folder<br>
(c.bat deletes existing class files and runs ANT)<br>
Output: !DFTEditor.jar<br>

#summary Instructions for using the software.

== Step 1: Adding files to be analyzed ==

Select .WAV files to be analyzed.<br>  
_.WAV files must be 16 bit, stereo, 44.1kHz sampling rate (same as a standard CD)_<br>
_See *DFT Input* in [DataFormatsAndConstants Data Formats and Constants] for more infomation_<br>

Copy .WAV files into the [DFTEditorFolder DFTEditor Folder] (which contains DFTEditor.jar and a.exe)<br>
_(It is assumed you have already completed the steps outlined in [BuildInstructions Build Instructions])_<br>

Open a command line window set to the DFTEditor directory, and run r.bat (or the contents of r.bat)<br>
You can run DFTEditor.jar just by clicking on it, but you won't be able to see the progress that is written to the console (and the -Xms2g option may be be needed for larger files, see *Running* in [DFTEditor DFTEditor Folder])<br>
It may take 10 - 30 minutes to analyze a 5 minute long .wav file.  The DFTEditor GUI will be displayed once all new .wav files have been analyzed.<br>
DFTEditor.jar will create a .mono5ms file from the data in each .wav file.  This .mono5ms file contains the frequency domain data for the cooresponding .wav file.<br>

== Step 2: Running DFTEditor ==

_*Note: This is experimental software, so some menu options may not be implemented.*_

Start DFTEditor (see *Running* in [DFTEditor DFTEditor Folder])<br>
Select .mono5ms file to view from the File Prompt (which will come up automatically)<br>
To view another file, select File->Open from the menu bar.<br>

Use the navigation bar to adjust the times and frequencies displayed.

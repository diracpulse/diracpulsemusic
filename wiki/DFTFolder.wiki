== Overview ==

Conversion from PCM into the frequency domain (Time -> Frequency -> Amplitude)
is done in C for performance reasons.<br>
The algorithm resembles a DFT, but unlike the DFT, the length of the window
used is increased as the frequency decreased.<br>
The frequency and amplitude at a particular time are calculated by a wavelet
centered about the sample at that particular time.<br>
Each wavelet has a maximum response to a particular frequency that decreases
as the input frequency is increased or decreased.<br>
If response(freq + 1) <= response(freq) >= response(freq - 1)
and response is above a particular minimum threshold,<br>
it is assumed that freq exists at that particular time and that amplitude == response<br>

== Files ==

*main.c (original file):* takes a file input.wav and produces a TFA output.<br>
Output is space delimited (three numbers per line) and terminated with a \n:<br>
`int Time = (token[0] / 5ms)`<br>
`int Frequency = 2.0 ^ (token[1] / 31.0)`<br> 
`float Amplitude = 2.0 ^ (token[2])`<br>
